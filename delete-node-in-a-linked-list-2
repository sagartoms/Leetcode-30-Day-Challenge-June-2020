# INPUT:  Only the node to be deleted
# OUTPUT: None (inplace)
# IDEA:   Run a pointer from given node to tail node. Copy values from preceeding node to current node.
#         Finally, update the second last node as tail node (next=None) - Keep a variable to point the
#         previous node.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
